# `MONTY`

### `objective`
To create an interpretor that reads a file containing monty bytecode and executes the opcode  

The essense of this project was to gain a firm understanding of linked list to implement STACKS and QUEUES. A further understanding of structs was of key value towards the implementation.  
Leveraging from a variety of system call functions was also key to properly undergo operations such as reading from a file that will be in monty opcode structure. The pseudocode for the whole operation is:
* Take input as a file
* Loop through the file to obtain the lines
* Tokenize the lines to obtain the opcode fuctionality and it's parameter
* check if the commands are valid operations within the list of functions, as well as if the parameter value is an integer
* Execute operation if valid

Some common operations will be to add data, delete it, manipulate it as well as conduct operations such as addition and subtraction
